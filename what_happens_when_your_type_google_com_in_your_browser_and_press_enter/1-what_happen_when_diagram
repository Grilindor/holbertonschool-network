Here is a simple diagram illustrating the flow of a web request when a user types "https://www.google.com" in the browser and presses Enter. The diagram visually represents the key components:

1. DNS Resolution
2. Request reaching the server IP
3. Encrypted traffic (HTTPS)
4. Traffic passing through a firewall
5. Load balancer distributing the request
6. Web server serving the page
7. Application server generating the page
8. Database query
This should help non-developers understand the basic flow of a web request.
